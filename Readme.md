# About

This game is still a prototype, it's not finished and maybe it never is, however its development was
due to the author's attempt to visualize the library's capabilities **Bearlibterminal** and **C99**, in
addition to improve the knowledge gaps produced by a language such as C99.

When compiling and running the game there is an aspect that surprises, is the title screen, a red with a
word in white, "Ingsoc", all done and designed with characters (Not an image), this screen
could be designed thanks to **REXPaint-v1.04**, I exported it in CVS format, and subsequently
drawn on screen with the Bearlibterminal library (Great tool).
